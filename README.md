"If I'am not personally at high risk for COVID-19, why should I wear a mask?"If this type of attitude goes on... we won't be able to fight against Novel Corona Virus.<br/>
India has been unlocking in phases. Malls, temples and other public places has been unlocked. Things are back to normal but, it is not "new normal". Wearing masks is must but still many people resist to do so.

# Overview

Now-a-days, entering any public premises is dangerous, with more possibilites of spreading of COVID-19. With respect to this problem, here comes our proposed system! The COVID-19 Face-Mask Detector. It is a real-time operating system, which detects if a person enetring the premises is wearing mask or not. If yes, its says, "Great! You have got your mask on! Kindly use sanitizer, have a great day!":thumbsup: and if you're not, "Kindly wear your mask! You are not allowed to enter!":thumbsdown:. <br/>The model we've build could be potentially used to ensure the saftey.
